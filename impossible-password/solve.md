This is a binary file so I opened it in **Binary Ninja**. Fortunatly this binary is not obfuscated and we can see the main and a comparasion with a static string

And sure enought if we enter **SuperSeKretKey** we are passing the check. If we look further in the code we can see that this function is generating our 2nd key so it seems that wee need to reverse engineer this function to get the key.

I think we can use the **IDA Pro Remote Linux Debuger** in order to get the key because it seems to be randomly generated.
I found something interesting let's see if it is an actual password

The Code it **KWOd05a{>c** but it is not because is it randomly generated by the functon every time
Hmm let's try to patch the code so it does not check for the key
I am going to use **R2** to patch this binary. I just added a **jmp** instruction so it will execute as if the password would have been correct.
And sure enougt after saving it we got the flag **HTB{40b949f92b86b18}**
